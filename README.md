FUNCTIONS
*********

    - createBar takes an array as a parameter and displays an in-line "rectangle" div for each element in the array


**********
NEXT STEPS

- Update createBar function to return a div with height based on the magnitude of the element
- Update createBar function to return a div with width based on the number of elements included in the array
- Update the onClick function prompt to take labels as well as numbers (objects rather than 1D array)
